# Genetic-Ancestry-PhD
Genetic Ancestry Pharmacogenomic Database is based on the whole-genome sequencing data from The 1000 Genomes Project and four public pharmacogenetics resources (Drug Bank, PharmGKB, PharmaADME, and Biotransformation), we establish this genetic ancestry pharmacogenomics database “Genetic Ancestry PhD”. This database provides a catalog of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) and ancestry informative genes (AIGs) associated with drugs and their related pharmacogenetics information for global continents and populations.

- **Ancestry informative marker search**

  Ancestry informative markers (AIMs) can be used to trace the origin of individuals who have differential genetic background and have been applied to various study fields such as population genetics, medical genetics, forensic sciences, and animal sciences. These markers are identified and can be searched by **rsnumber** from https://0jiawei0.github.io/Genetic-Ancestry-PhD/aim.html
  
- **Ancestry informative gene search**

  Ancestry informative genes (AIGs) that have a significant difference of homozygosity intensity (HI) among the studied populations in a continent and among the five-continent ancestry groups are identified. These genes are identified and can be searched by **gene symbol** from https://0jiawei0.github.io/Genetic-Ancestry-PhD/aig.html
