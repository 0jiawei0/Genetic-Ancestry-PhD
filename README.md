# Genetic-Ancestry-PhD
Genetic Ancestry Pharmacogenomic Database is based on the whole-genome sequencing data from The 1000 Genomes Project and four public pharmacogenetics resources (Drug Bank, PharmGKB, PharmaADME, and Biotransformation), we establish this genetic ancestry pharmacogenomics database “Genetic Ancestry PhD”. This database provides a catalog of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) and ancestry informative genes (AIGs) associated with drugs and their related pharmacogenetics information for global continents and populations.
